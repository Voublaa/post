           <p>Most of us think only people with diabetes have high blood sugar level.
            Is it right? Anyone can suffer from this & may not notice the harm being done to nerves, 
           blood vessels & organs. To prevent complications you should
            recognise various symptoms in time. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>12. Constant Hunger</h2>
                       <img class="ct_img" src="one/two.svg">
            <p>You have just eaten lunch & even dessert but still look for more food.
            Its a sign you are probably eating lot of sugar. 
           High blood sugar prevent glucose entering the cells. As a result the body
            doesn't receive energy & ask for food again & again: Its a vicious circle. 
           Try to cut off creamy dessert, carbonated drinks & dont put sugar in your tea 
           or coffee & you will see the result very soon.
           </p>
           
           <h2>11. Increased fatigue</h2>
           <p>Did you ever felt like you haven't woken up yet, but you already feel tired.
            There is a simple explanation for this. At high blood sugar level, your body 
           can't absorb glucose properly. Energy is used inefficiently, & body cell don't recieve
            the fuel they need. Thats why you often feel tired for no reason. Can cut sugar all at once?
            Atleast replace it with honey, well with a small spoon.
            </p>
            
            <h2>10. frequent urination </h2>
                   <img class="ct_img" src="one/three.svg">
            <p>If the blood sugar is too high, the kidneys cannot reabsorb fluid.
            Why is a bad thing? Your body, trying to equalize the glucose concentration 
           in the blood & cells, dissolves blood with intracellular fluid. This bring the concentration 
           of glucose to normal & results in frequent urination. In other words, you run to the bathroom 
           almost every 5 minutes. To stop these annoying things, say 'no' to candies, ice-cream, muffins & other 
           sweets you love. Atleast give it a try.
            </p>
           
           
           
           <h2>9. Dry mouth, excessive thirst</h2>
                <img class="ct_img" src="one/four.svg">
           <p>A dry mouth & thirst are responses to severe fluid loss. 
           The hypothalamus, which causes thirst, sends a corresponding signal to the brain.
            Of course you cannot refuse to drink, but it's better if you choose water or tea without sugar. 
           Avoid drinking juice boxes - they contain a lot of sugar! If you don't like the taste of plain water, 
           add a piece of lemon, mint leaves or strawberry halves into the glass. This simple trick will make your water taste awesome. 
           </p>
           
           
           <h2>8. Weight loss</h2>
                   <img class="ct_img" src="one/five.svg">
           <p>With a high glucose level, 
           you can lose weight within a short period even if your meal contains a lot of calories. 
           Here are several reasons for this:
           <br/>
           Fluid loss leads to a low fluid level in your body & it result in weight loss
           <br/>
           If the insulin level is insufficient for glucose metabolism, your body will start burning fat faster
           <br/>
           A large amount of urine at a high level of glucose makes the body spend a lot of calories. In this way your body try to dump excess glucose.
           </p>
           
                       
                       
                       
                       
               <h2>7. Infectious diseases </h2>
                <img class="ct_img" src="one/six.svg">
               <p>Urinary tract infections & yeast infections can occur in both men & women. 
           However, more often they occur in women with high sugar levels & diabetes. 
           A significant amount of sugar creates a favourable environment for yeasts & bacteria growth. 
           Want to stay healthy? Eat as less sugar as possible. Atleast try to cut your sugar from your diet for a week,
            then for a month & so on. As a result you will change your eating habits naturally & without stress.
            </p>
            
            <h2>6. Dry skin</h2>
                                     <img class="ct_img" src="one/seven.svg">
            <p>Did you know that dry skin connects with high blood 
           sugar levels? Here are the reasons: <br/>
           • Excessive urination dehydrates your body to such an extent that your skin begins to dry.
           <br/>
           • Legs skin problems are a sign of narrowing of the arteries & poor blood circulation.
           <br/>
           • Damaged nerves can disrupt the normal function of the sweat glands. Also affect the skin water balance.
           <br/>
           </p>
           
           <h2>5. Concentrating difficulties </h2>
                    <img class="ct_img" src="one/eight.svg">
           <p>We all know the phrase that our brains need sugar for better work. However,
            high blood levels prevent glucose from entering the brain cells. So the brain experience
            difficulties obtaining energy. It affects the speed of thinking & decision-making. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>4. Blurred vision</h2>
                       <img class="ct_img" src="one/nine.svg">
            <p>Blurred vision is also the result of a dehydrating effect due to high blood sugar,
            & it also affects the cells of your eyes. As a result, they reform & the eye loses its ability to focus properly.
            </p>
            
            <h2>3. Slow healing of wounds & cuts</h2>
               
            <p>Do you notice your wounds & cuts heal slower than usual?
            That happens due to vascular damage. It is a result of high sugar levels & it leads to
            poorer blood circulation, Especially in limbs & insufficient nutrition of tissues. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>2. Impotence</h2>
            <p>Difficulties maintaining an erection can also occur because of high blood glucose. 
           A normal erection requires healthy nerves, good blood flow & proper balance of hormones. 
           An excess of sugar in your blood can affect each of these systems.
           </p>
           
           <h2>1. Irritability</h2>
           <img class="ct_img" src="one/ten.svg">
           <p>According to research, people with high sugar are more anxious. The brain depends on an 
           equal supply of glucose & abrupt changes in its level affect its work negatively. As a result, your mood
            suddenly gets worse. Sugar also affects the absorption of another nutrient responsible for mood: 'Chromium'.
            This mineral is needed to maintain a stable level of blood sugar. Insulin, which removes glucose from the blood, 
           can't work properly without it.
