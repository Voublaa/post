	<p>There is nothing more refreshing than a glass of water. However, more than half the world's population suffer from dehydration, 
without even realising that this can lead to serious health problems. Read this till the end to learn the ways in which dehydration can have negative 
affect & a simple way to ....... in 5 seconds. This valuable information should taught in every school. Before considering the main science of dehydration 
let's see what will happen if you dont drink enough water. Your body is 60%-80% water. So if you don't drink enough water every day, it disappears:
</p>

<p>1. From your blood, upto 8%<br/>
This leads to narrow blood vessels, blood clots, raised blood pressure & risk of heart attack & stroke.
<br/><br/>
2. water disappear from intercellular space upto 26%
<br/>
This leads to raised acidity levels, gout, kidney stones, brittle bones, lower immunity. 
<br/><br/>
3. water disappear from your cells upto 66%
<br/>
This leads to higher cholesterol, reduced metabolism & accelerated aging. 
<br/>
</p>

<h2>1. Your Mouth is dry</h2>
<p>Any time you feel that sticky, nasty feeling in your mouth, you'd obviously reach for some liquid. Keep in mind that sugary drinks are only
 a temporary solution to a large problem! Drinking water lubricates the mucous membranes in your mouth & throat. Which will continue to keep 
your mouth moist with saliva long after that first sip.
</p>

<h2>2. Your Skin is dry</h2>
<p>
Your skin is your body's largest organ, so it needs to stay hydrated. In fact, dry skin is one of the earliest signs of full-on dehydration. A lack of water means a lack of sweat, which leads to a body's inability to wash away excess dirt and oil accumulated throughout the day. If you want to stave off breakouts, your first recourse should be to drink more water. 
</p>

<h2>3. You're very thirsty</h2>
<p>
We went over dry mouth already, but thirst goes beyond a desert-like tongue. Anyone who's ever had a hangover can tell you that, upon waking up, your body can't get enough water. Alcohol dehydrates the entire body & drinking water sends 'yes please!' signals to the brain untill your fluid levels get back to baseline. Listen to what your body is telling you; It knows what it's talking about! 
</p>

<h2>4. Your eyes are dry</h2>
<p>
By now it should be clear that drinking water affects more than just your mouth & throat. A lack of water intake leads to dry, bloodshot eyes. Without water in the body, your tear ducts dry up, & this can cause much more harm to your eyes. Especially if you were contact everyday. 
</p>

<h2>5. You have joint pain</h2>
<p>
Your cartilage & spinal discs are made up of about 80% water. This is an absolute necessity to keep your bones from grinding against each other with every step you take. By keeping your body hydrated, you ensure that your joints can absorb the shock of sudden movements. Such as running, jumping or falling awkwardly. 
</p>

<h2>6. Your muscle mass decreases</h2>
<p>
Your muscle, also, are comprised mostly of water. Obviously less water in the body means less muscle mass. Drinking water before, during & after a workout not only keeps you hydrated & comfortable, it also brings water to the right places in your body & decreases the chances of developing inflammation & soreness related to exercise & weightlifting. 
</p>

<h2>7. You stay sick longer</h2>
<p>
Drinking water allows your body to flush out toxins continuously. Your organs work to filter out certain waste products like a machine, but if you don't fuel the machine with water, it cannot work properly. what ends up happening in a dehydrated body is organs start to pull water from stored areas like your blood, which leads to a whole new set of problems. 
</p>

<h2>8. You feel fatigued & lethargic </h2>
<p>
When a body is dehydrated it "borrows" water from your blood & a lack of properly hydrated blood leads to a lack of oxygen being brought throughout the body. Of course, a lack of oxygen leads to sleepiness & outright fatigue. A lack of stamina means you'll start to experience that 2 pm crash earlier & earlier in your day. Remember coffee won't help for longer.
</p>

<h2>9. You experience hunger pangs</h2>
<p>
When you're dehydrated, your body might start to think it needs some food. This happens throughout the day & overnight when you wake up craving that midnight snack. However, eating food creates more work for your body, whereas drinking water purifies your organs & supplies it with the fuel it needs to go through the other processes a body goes through. 
</p>

<h2>10. You have digestive problems</h2>
<p>
We read above about the mucus in our mouth & throat, & how keeping hydrated allows the membrane to function correctly. This also applies to the entire digestive system. Without proper hydration, the amount & strength of mucus in the stomach lessen, Allowing stomach acid to do some significant damage to your insides. This leads to what we commonly refer to as heartburn & indigestion. 
</p>

<h2>11. You experience premature aging </h2>
<p>
The amount of water your bodies retain naturally decreases as you age. While premature aging is more evident on the outside, the damages it does to our insides will ultimately be felt over time.
</p>

<p>So whom you are waiting for? Start drinking water right now itself.
