     <p>It's believed that all of us keep growing tall up to 26 years old. Nevertheless,
 this process is purely individual. Some people start growing at 16 to 18 years old, but some continue 
till 25. 3 critical factors affect the growth:
<br/>
• Hormone Regulation
<br/>
• Healthy Bones
<br/>
• Good Food
<br/>
Let's first look at the list of foods that can help you increase height significantly.
</p>

<h2>10. Eggs</h2>
<p>Chicken eggs help you maintain a level of energy. They are rich in vitamin B, which affects the production
 of energy in the cells in your body. Also, eggs contain a high amount of protein, which is good for muscle growth. 
Our body uses protein for all physical processes; therefore, to grow taller, your body needs more protein. Moreover, eggs 
contain the essential amino acids & minerals that are necessary for healthy bones & fast growth such as calcium, zinc & iron. 
Eat 1 or 2 eggs for breakfast on an ordinary day or 1 or 2 for dinner on your training days. To avoid the risk of salmonella, you should 
boil or bake eggs before eating rather than consuming them raw. 
</p>

<h2>9. Beef</h2>
<p>Beef contains much more protein than other types of meat. It is rich in vitamin E, B12 & zinc, which is useful for activating the production 
of the growth hormone, somatropin. Also, it contains protein that, as we know, is the best building material for growth. Beef is rich in a significant 
amount of iron. It fills the cells in your body with oxygen, participates in all metabolic processes & improves overall health. 
</p>

<h2>8. Vegetables</h2>
<p>Red & orange vegetables such as carrots, red bell pepper, pumkin & tomatoes contain a significant amount of vitamin A.
 Dark green & green leafy vegetables are known to have a lot of vitamins & minerals. Many of these vegetables contain calcium & vitamin D. 
Also cabbage, spinach & broccoli are good source of vitamin K. 
</p>

<h2>7. Walnuts</h2>
<p>Recent studies have shown that the components contained in these nuts can strengthen bone tissue. Also vitamin E, calcium & phosphorus 
affect your growth. You can eat nuts as snacks, add them to salads & desserts, or even make nut milk. Dont forget to add some nuts to yogurts
 or cereals for breakfast. 
 </p>
 
 <h2>6. Seafood</h2>
 <p>Any seafood especially shellfish, is an excellent food for increasing height. It contains a lot of energy vitamins, for example, B12. Seafood is
 also a source of high-quality protein. We suggest eating seafood for dinner as it contains few carbohydrates. It activates the
 growth hormone while you're sleeping. 
 </p>
 
 <h2>5. Oily fish</h2>
 <p>Oily fish contain vitamin A that is the most important growth stimulant. It's responsible for the production of collagen 
fibers that form bone tissue. Fish oil also contains vitamin D, which help to produce bone-forming cells. Also, this vitamin helps
 your body absorb calcium faster. 
 </p>

			
<h2>4. Honey</h2>
<p>
Honey consists of simple sugars, which your body can absorb quickly. Honey gives you a lot of energy & does not affect your insulin level. Also, it deliveries minerals to your body, which are necessary for growth. Adding honey to your diet helps calcium & magnesium be absorbed better that makes your bones healthy. You can eat honey instead of sugar, adding it to tea, coffee or yogurt. 
</p>
<h2>3. Milk</h2>
<p>
In case you have some diseases - for example, diabetes - it's better to avoid milk. However, if you have no problems with health, you can drink 2-3 glasses of milk a day to accelerate growth. Milk is rich in calcium, vitamin A & protein. 
</p>
<h2>2. Bananas</h2>
<p>
bananas are one of the best foods to increase height. The vitamin & efficient compounds within them always guard your body. The abundance of vitamins & minerals make bananas a great source of energy. Simple carbs are quick to digest & can replenish your energy resource almost immediately if need be. Moreover, banana is one of the best food sources of potassium. You can add bananas to oats or cereals for breakfast. Also, such fruits as apples, plums & pears are very useful for growth.
</p>
<h2>1. Oats</h2>
<p>
Oatmeal is the best product for increasing height. It consists of all the main components & minerals that help you grow & give you a lot of energy. A plate of oats for breakfast brings all useful elements to your body, such as:
<br/>
• potassium 
<br/>
• magnesium 
<br/>
• phosphorus 
<br/>
• iodine
<br/>
• zinc
<br/>
• iron
<br/>
• vitamin A, B, E & K groups.

All of them make your bones & muscle tissue strong & healthy.
